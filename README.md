 <h4>virtual internship at CodSoft Company in Java programming </h4>

The first task was the "Number Game," which involved creating a Java program to generate and manipulate random numbers within a specified range. This task not only deepened my understanding of random number generation but also honed my problem-solving skills.

The second task, "Word Count," focused on developing a program to analyze a given text and determine the frequency of each word. This task improved my string manipulation techniques and taught me how to efficiently store and retrieve data using data structures. It was a practical exercise in working with text data, which is a common scenario in programming projects.

The third and final task was the creation of a "Student Management System." This task encompassed designing a Java application to manage student records, including their personal information, grades, and enrollment status. Building this system sharpened my object-oriented programming skills and provided insights into creating user-friendly interfaces.
